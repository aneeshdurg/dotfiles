# dotfiles
Backups of some config files/aliases/etc.

Don't copy the files out from the dotfiles directory, but use symlinks instead so that everything is in one place.

.bashrc contains extensions for my bashrc, to use, add the line `source ~/dotfiles/.bashrc` to the real .bashrc.

This also may come in handy for trackpads:

for clipboard support with nvim:
sudo apt install xclip

old.tar.gz has files from back when I used to use windows.
